# The-tiny-encryption-algorithm-TEA-
## Description
This project implements the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) in ECB and CBC modes to encrypt and decrypt images. The program reads an image, encrypts it using TEA, converts the encrypted image to grayscale (in the case of ECB mode), and then decrypts the image back.

## Requirements
